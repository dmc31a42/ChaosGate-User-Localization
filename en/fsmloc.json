  "R3_4_LINE16_AEGER": "Thank you, nephew…",
  "R3_4_LINE17_LUNETE": "Damage reduction 100%",
  "R3_4_LINE18_ECTAR": "You must clear those pests from your firing vector, they sacrifice themselves for their master!",
  "R3_4_LINE19_AEGER": "Dullard! That would have served a sacred birthing ground...",
  "R3_4_LINE20_ECTAR": "Good work, Commander, purge them all!",
  "R3_4_LINE21_ECTAR": "Impressive tactic! We must bathe them all in purifying flame!",
  "R3_4_LINE22_ECTAR": "A worthy blow, Brother! See how the bloated pig struggles!",
  "R3_6_LINE01_ECTAR": "The Reaper is purged, our duty fulfilled.",
  "R3_6_LINE02_LUNETE": "Concern: Nurgling infestation lingers…",
  "R3_6_LINE03_LUNETE": "Unorthodox deployment of Exterminatus recommended for absolute certainty.",
  "R3_6_LINE04_ECTAR": "It is done, Dominus, be at peace.",
  "R3_6_LINE05_ECTAR": "Those foul spawn will not survive long without their brood-master..",
  "R3_6_LINE06_VAKIR": "Yes, truly, we must recover the Prime Seed and pursue the others!",
  "R3_6_LINE07_LUNETE": "Denial: Risk of infestation remains.",
  "R3_6_LINE08_ECTAR": "If I must, I will venture below personally and purge the immediate area before we return anything to the ship.",
  "R3_6_LINE09_AEGER": "Such is the power of the true plague, but I have yet much to tend.",
  "R3_6_LINE10_AEGER": "Fare thee well...",
  "R3_6_LINE11_VAKIR": "Blast it! That was a precious chance we’ve lost, Commander!",
  "R3_6_LINE12_ECTAR": "A setback for certain, but we will find it again, and we will prevail.",
  "R4_3_LINE01_CRUCIATUS": "Lo- I sense a putrid decay in the Warp...",
  "R4_3_LINE02_CRUCIATUS": "Knights of Titan!",
  "R4_3_LINE03_CRUCIATUS": "I, Cruciatus, am known to my cohort as The Generous…",
  "R4_3_LINE04_CRUCIATUS": "For it is through my will that the healing gift of Pain should be shared in the Grandfather’s name!",
  "R4_3_LINE05_CRUCIATUS": "It is a noble goal, is it not?!",
  "R4_3_LINE06_ECTAR": "Brothers, do not deign answer his blasphemy, our duty is not to bandy in words…",
  "R4_3_LINE07_CRUCIATUS": "Will you not parlay?",
  "R4_3_LINE08_CRUCIATUS": "Introduce yourselves!",
  "R4_3_LINE09_LUNETE": "Knight Classification: Desecrator... Its firepower is beyond--",
  "R4_3_LINE10_ECTAR": "--Beyond our capabilities!",
  "R4_3_LINE11_ECTAR": "Commander, I recommend we reconsider our approach and--",
  "R4_3_LINE12_CRUCIATUS": "--Retreat?... I had thought your type “knew no fear”, an empty platitude it would seem.",
  "R4_3_LINE13_LUNETE": "Warp Surge! Interference is---",
  "R4_3_LINE14_CRUCIATUS": "Hmph. Retreat would be dishonorable...",
  "R4_3_LINE15_CRUCIATUS": "Besides, I have long awaited the day when I might truly be challenged!",
  "R4_3_LINE16_CRUCIATUS": "Come at me, Knights of Titan, I promise your end will not be swift!",
  "R4_3_LINE17_CRUCIATUS": "And lo Titan’s spawn hath returned!",
  "R4_3_LINE18_CRUCIATUS": "Who would challenge me again?",
  "R4_3_LINE19_ECTAR": "Brothers! This is a chance to redeem ourselves, show this abomination what it means to be called a true knight!",
  "R4_4_LINE01_CRUCIATUS": "Blasted curse of a face!",
  "R4_4_LINE02_CRUCIATUS": "There! It would been unseemly to have defeated you half blind!",
  "R4_4_LINE04_LUNETE": "... Voxx communication re-established, but Warp interference remains.",
  "R4_4_LINE05_LUNETE": "Teleportation is impossible.",
  "R4_4_LINE06_VAKIR": "Ectar I believe I may yet be able to pierce this veil, but the strain is significant.",
  "R4_4_LINE07_ECTAR": "Then we must watch and provide what little support we can.",
  "R4_4_LINE08_LUNETE": "Analysis: Ion Shielding is formidable, however its power regulation is inconsistent.",
  "R4_4_LINE09_ECTAR": "Some side effect of the Bloom’s corruption?",
  "R4_4_LINE10_LUNETE": "Unknown. Commander, your firepower may be sufficient to overwhelm its generator",
  "R4_4_LINE11_ECTAR": "What about penetrating that armour?",
  "R4_4_LINE12_LUNETE": "Unlikely.",
  "R4_4_LINE13_LUNETE": "The Desecrator’s power systems are overwhelmed.",
  "R4_4_LINE14_ECTAR": "This is your chance brothers!",
  "R4_4_LINE15_ECTAR": "Find some vulnerability and strike!",
  "R4_4_LINE16_LUNETE": "Observation: Industrial lifts contain a significant Plasma payload",
  "R4_4_LINE17_ECTAR": "Hmm, perhaps those cranes can be used to some advantage.",
  "R4_4_LINE18_LUNETE": "Destructive force: Substantial. Ectar-",
  "R4_4_LINE19_ECTAR": "Yes, if we can lure the beast near to one of those cranes, we might tip the odds in our favor.",
  "R4_4_LINE20_ECTAR": "That’s got it! Dominus?",
  "R4_4_LINE21_LUNETE": "The Knight’s structural integrity is... Unaffected.",
  "R4_4_LINE22_ECTAR": "What?",
  "R4_4_LINE23_LUNETE": "However the fallen shoulder plate has exposed vulnerable mechanical systems.",
  "R4_4_LINE24_ECTAR": "We must focus our efforts there!",
  "R4_4_LINE25_LUNETE": "Significant internal damage detected.",
  "R4_4_LINE26_ECTAR": "Is that it?",
  "R4_4_LINE27_ECTAR": "Is it done?",
  "R4_4_LINE28_LUNETE": "Negative: The Knight still moves, however its operations are impaired.",
  "R4_6_LINE01_ECTAR": "The Veil is lifting... It is done.",
  "R4_6_LINE02_LUNETE": "Operational control restored.",
  "R4_6_LINE03_ECTAR": "This is an impressive victory!",
  "R4_6_LINE04_ECTAR": "The halls of Titan will echo with the deed of those brothers who bested a Chaos Knight single-handed!",
  "R4_6_LINE05_VAKIR": "Single-handed, Ectar?",
  "R4_6_LINE06_VAKIR": "No matter, such festivities can wait:",
  "R4_6_LINE07_VAKIR": "We must extract the Prime Seed and continue the hunt.",
  "R4_6_LINE08_CRUCIATUS": "The true champion reigns victorious!",
  "R4_6_LINE09_CRUCIATUS": "For now I have duties to attend, but seek me out when Titan produces someone worthy of my prowess!",
  "R4_6_LINE10_LUNETE": "The auspex is silent.",
  "R4_6_LINE11_VAKIR": "This is far from ideal, Commander. We need that Prime Seed.",
  "R4_6_LINE12_ECTAR": "Return to the Edict so we can plan our next move.",
  "R5_3_LINE01_ECTAR": "This creature... It is Munificus?",
  "R5_3_LINE02_LUNETE": "Confirmed: Designation, Chaos Spawn.",
  "R5_3_LINE03_ECTAR": "That is no Chaos Spawn I have ever encountered…",
  "R5_3_LINE04_LUNETE": "Analysis: No apparent defensive systems.",
  "R5_3_LINE05_ECTAR": "Is it possible this Reaper was somehow stillborn?",
  "R5_3_LINE06_ECTAR": "Brothers, be wary as you approach!",
  "R5_3_LINE08_ECTAR": "Commander, ready your blades, we must purge this beast!",
  "R5_4_LINE01_LUNETE": "Fascinating: Complete cellular atrophication and renewal.",
  "R5_4_LINE02_ECTAR": "Yes, the beast has mutated from the Bloom, we should divine its strengths more thoroughly... ",
  "R5_4_LINE03_LUNETE": "Damage yields insufficient.",
  "R5_4_LINE04_LUNETE": "The beast exhibits instantaneous regeneration.",
  "R5_4_LINE05_ECTAR": "Commander, these tactics are proving futile!",
  "R5_4_LINE06_ECTAR": "The beast’s attacks are tied to its limbs, sever them!",
  "R5_4_LINE07_ECTAR": "Brothers, ready your blades and strike!",
  "R5_4_LINE08_ECTAR": "That’s it Brothers!",
  "R5_4_LINE09_LUNETE": "Update: The limb has transformed into pure Bloom essence.",
  "R5_4_LINE10_ECTAR": "Brothers, watch out for those Bloomspawn!",
  "R5_4_LINE11_LUNETE": "Status Update: The Reaper appears unable to regenerate its limbs.",
  "R5_4_LINE12_ECTAR": "You hear that Brothers?",
  "R5_4_LINE13_ECTAR": "Press the advantage, destroy this monster!",
  "R5_6_LINE01_ECTAR": "The Undying was an unworthy epithet.",
  "R5_6_LINE02_ECTAR": "Well done, Commander.",
  "R5_6_LINE03_VAKIR": "The celebration can come later, Purifier.",
  "R5_6_LINE04_VAKIR": "We must recover that Prime Seed.",
  "R5_6_LINE05_LUNETE": "Concordance: Extraction process initiated.",
  "R5_6_LINE06_VAKIR": "The beast’s anima has dispersed... We’ve lost it!",
  "R5_6_LINE07_ECTAR": "An unfortunate setback.",
  "R5_6_LINE08_VAKIR": "We must redouble our efforts!",
  "R5_6_LINE09_VAKIR": "This Reaper cannot be left to live!",
  "III_10_1_LINE01_DRAIGO": "Mortarion has channelled the power of a Bloom strain directly.",
  "III_10_1_LINE02_DRAIGO": "If we weaken him, I may have a hope of severing its Root.",
  "III_10_1_LINE03_MORTARION": "Ever since you dared carve that name on my heart, our fates have been entwined.",
  "III_10_1_LINE04_MORTARION": "Your part in this was my design, I will heap misery on your accursed chapter!",
  "III_10_1_LINE09_MORTARION": "I can still taste the Inquisitor; a lingering mote of her tormented soul...",
  "III_10_1_LINE05_MORTARION": "I shall have vengeance on the chapter that has plagued my Death Guard for millennia!",
  "III_10_1_LINE13_MORTARION": "Vengeance proves sweeter than the Inquisitor’s soul!",
  "III_10_1_LINE06_MORTARION": "You cannot harm me here in Grandfather’s garden!",
  "III_10_1_LINE07_MORTARION": "The Bloom sustains us.",
  "III_10_1_LINE10_MORTARION": "How desperate the Sigillite’s legion has become. Weaklings!",
  "III_10_1_LINE14_MORTARION": "Your petty warlocks will bother me no more!",
  "III_10_1_LINE08_MORTARION": "How dare you trample my beloved roots!",
  "III_10_1_LINE15_MORTARION": "Insects! You cannot stop me!",
  "III_10_1_LINE11_MORTARION": "Enough! Behold my wrath, Malcador’s little step-children.",
  "III_10_1_LINE16_MORTARION": "Grandfather Nurgle protect your son!",
  "III_10_1_LINE17_MORTARION": "My bloom!",
  "III_10_1_LINE18_MORTARION": "Kadex, you treacherous worm, what have you wrought?",
  "III_10_1_LINE19_KADEX": "I did only as you requested, master!",
  "III_10_1_LINE20_MORTARION": "Draigo! You cannot win!",
  "III_10_1_LINE21_MORTARION": "Plague comes for the Imperium, I have eternity to ensure it festers!"
